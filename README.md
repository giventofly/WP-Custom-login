# Wordpress custom login/register/forget pwd example

Can see a semi working example withe Js to send the requests [here (codepen)](https://codepen.io/giventofly/pen/BOZpPQ).

I commented some of the stuff but the gist of it is to have a form on a page/sidebar, send an post request (using wordpress built-in ajax).

Simply put, you got your functions to login/register/forget password, i guess its a nice boilerplate to begin. In the codepen example you have the JS to dome most of the frontend stuff (i will put it here too).
